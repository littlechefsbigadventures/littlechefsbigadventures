    <h3>Tips for Picky Eaters</h3>
    <p>Navigating picky eating in Nibbletopia can be a challenge, but these Air Fryer Sausage Patties make it easier. Here are some tips to get your little chefs excited about breakfast:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Involve Them in Prep:</strong> Let kids help shape the patties. Use cookie cutters for fun shapes like stars or hearts to make the meal more inviting.</li>
      <li><strong>Pair with Favorites:</strong> Serve with a familiar side like scrambled eggs or toast to ease them into trying the patties. Familiar foods lower the “new food” anxiety.</li>
      <li><strong>Control the Spices:</strong> Use mild spices like a pinch of paprika or skip them entirely if your child prefers plain flavors. You can gradually introduce spices as they get comfortable.</li>
      <li><strong>Dip It Up:</strong> Offer ketchup, mustard, or a mild sauce for dipping. Dipping is fun and can make new foods less intimidating for picky eaters.</li>
      <li><strong>Small Bites, Big Wins:</strong> Make mini patties (1-inch size) for smaller portions. Tiny bites feel less overwhelming and encourage trying without pressure.</li>
      <li><strong>Celebrate the Crunch:</strong> Highlight the crispy texture as a fun feature. Say, “Listen to that crunch!” to make eating an adventure.</li>
    </ul>
